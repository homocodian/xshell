# XShell

XShell is a cross-platform, POSIX-compliant shell written in C++, originally started as a Codecrafters challenge.

## Goals

- ~~Basic shell functionality, including built-in commands, executing external programs, redirections, and tab completion~~
- Expand support for Windows (currently partial support)
- Optimize for blazing-fast performance while incorporating modern features
